# Genius Game

A genius style game, where the user clicks on the color that will be highlighted, in the correct sequence to pass the level.

On first version, the game works good.

For  second version, i implemented a score counter creating a counter() function. A issue was happened and the counter has starting by 1 and hasnt reseting, to solve it, i stablished that the counter in case of lose would start at 0, whi counter(score = 0).

To third version, i want to make a better buttom style to make the highlight more visible.

To fourth version, i want make a level system, where each level has less 10 seconds to user.

To five version, the last, i want make interface improvements, and use a gradient background.
